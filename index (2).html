      <p>
        A <b>bestseller</b> is a book or other media noted for its top selling status, with bestseller lists published
        by
        newspapers, magazines, and book store chains.
      <div>
        I've seen "New York Times Bestseller" written across the top of more books than I can count. It seems every
        other
        book I look at has this advertisement, so much so that I discount it as a meaningful accomplishment.
        <div>
          But what does it really mean? Is it based on number of copies sold? Does the New York Times actually have
          editors
          read the books and only choose ones that they enjoyed enough? </div>

        <div> It means that a book has been - for any length of time - on the New York Time's Best Seller's List. This
          list
          aggregates
          sales data from thousands of venues for several different genres of books. It gathers data weekly and the data
          is
          published two weeks after data gathering (so the November 28 print edition contains the November 14th data).
        </div>

        <div>

          <div>Being a New York Times best seller
            is not necessarily an <em>index of quality</em> . It is an index of
            "hotness." </div>
          A
          book is moving fast to make it onto that list. The idea behind advertising it is to help the book pick up even
          more
          steam. If a book spends several weeks on the list, this is an indication of a book that sells extremely well.
        </div>

        <div>The reason that it seems like this encompasses so many books is that you hear about books that are NYT best
          sellers
          because they are being purchased, read, and talked about. The reality is that this list contains fewer books
          than
          you
          would think.</div>

        <li>Selling a large number of copies (over 500 copies daily)</li>
        <li>Having a high Amazon sales rank</li>
        <li>Selling 35,000 copies of your book grants you a best-seller status</li>
      </ol>
      <div>However, a book that never appears on the New York Times Bestseller list may well be a bestseller and outsell
        books
        on that list
        over time.
      <p>Other books, like the Bible, “A Tale of Two Cities” or “Pride and Prejudice” never appear on bestseller lists
        but they continue to sell steadily and have far outsold most books making the bestseller lists simply by their
        quality,
        word of mouth, and acceptance as great literature.</p> </div>
